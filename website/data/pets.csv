Sasha,Approx. 2 years old,F,"Sasha was rescued with a litter of kittens a couple of years ago, and now it is time for her to find a fur-ever home that all cats desire. She is a tricolor tabby with plenty of fluffy white fur on her belly, making belly rubs so addictive if Sasha is game. Sasha is gentle, so she is very adoptable and there should be no personality issues to adjust to after adopting her. Still, a loving adopter or foster parent is wise to give Sasha time to get comfortable to their home; show Sasha your sweet side and give her treats to reinforce that you love her. The rewards to showing her love are worth the choice of letting her in your home sweet home. Welcome Sasha, and home sweet home will never be the same without her again.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SASHA-F-scaled-e1684201128741-1024x1024.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_20230515_110402-scaled-e1684200687488-1024x1024.jpg']"
Whitey,Approx. 6 years old,M,"Whitey may have looked like a healthy and happy stray dog, but in truth, he was in great pain. Someone attempted to castrate this poor boy by tying a rubber band tightly around his testicles. Thankfully, he received treatment at the shelter and is now fully recovered. Whitey is learning to trust humans again, and now he’s looking for a strong pack leader to give him a home.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Whitey-Before.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adopt-Whitey-1024x1024.jpg']"
Meldy,Approx. 1 year old,F,"If you are the type of dog owner that wants a 1-yr-old female Aspin that stays quiet at home, try to get to know Meldy. Meldy may be skittish and easily excited or nervous, but with the right home, she will calm down and get used to the love and care of a quiet human. Retirees will love Meldy as she can be a solo dog who stays indoors all the time. Meldy will bark and alert her owners to intruders, as she is sensitive and easily anxious. The rest of the time, she will stay at home with her loving human parents and wait for pets and treats. Take a chance on Meldy, our female Scooby Doo.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MELDY-8-1-21-576x1024.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_20220912_140255-scaled-e1684380671655-1024x1024.jpg']"
Haley,Approx. 4 years old,F,"When Haley, a hit and run victim, was found underneath a parked car, our volunteer rescuers were unsure if she would make it. After being treated for her injuries, our shelter vet was unsure if she would walk again. Haley also remained aloof for a while, and we were unsure if she would ever get over her fear. Well, Haley put all our uncertainties to rest by bouncing back and being one of the friendliest dogs at the shelter. We’re SURE that she’ll make the best canine companion ever!","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Haley-Before.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Adopt-Haley-1024x1024.jpg']"
Lucy,Approx. 9 years old,F,"We know that there are loving cat owners out there who are eagerly looking to foster or adopt a cat in desperate need of a home. Make Lucy, a senior female Puspin that has been with us since 2013, your best move. She is raring for a loving single person, couple, or family and promises to be well-behaved as she is no longer an energetic, playful kitten. Think: senior pets are some of the best choices for fur-ever friends. They love cuddles and belly rubs. They are affectionate without being too needy. And they warm up to owners quickly after being adopted. Make Lucy your first choice if you need a well-behaved, house-broken cat. She will shower you with love and gratitude the same.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_20230515_111123-scaled-e1684132020557-1024x1024.jpg']"
Cow,Approx. 4 years old,M,"Cow is a male Puspin that has resided in PAWS since 2019 and littermates of Cleo and needs a foster or adopter desperately. Cats that have lived in the shelter for some time deserve the most chance to get people’s notice as they are the likeliest to be loving and affectionate in their new environments with their humans. Cow will purr, beg for rubs and treats and jump on your lap to rub his face against you with so much excitement, you’ll swear he was thanking you for rescuing him. If he gets the idea that he needs to be chill and just relax while you spend your day working, Cow will wait until you’re ready. Be it a BFF or fur-ever family member, Cow is an investment in love.

Tiki,Approx. 3 years old,M,"Thanks to a concerned citizen’s report, Tiki was not killed for “pulutan” (food usually paired with alcoholic drink). Barangay officers foiled plans of construction workers who were about to slaughter him and criminal charges were filed by PAWS. Tiki remained a sweet, loving dog all throughout his ordeal -where he was only given scraps for food and drank rain water from a puddle near his chained area. When he was rescued, he wagged his tail non-stop and was very excited to get into the vehicle that would take him to the PAWS shelter. Tiki holds no grudges and wants to be friends with everyone he meets for the first time. he epitomizes the saying. ” To err is human, to forgive, canine” and reminds us why we should all work together to end the cruel and illegal dog meat trade in our country.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/adopt-tiki1.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Adopt-Tiki.jpg']"

Two of his siblings were already unresponsive from heatstroke.Now a fully-grown orange tabby ready for a fur-ever home, Heath is dreaming of human parents and siblings who will enjoy his company. Heath wants to be an indoor cat with a house to hide in, high places to climb and poles to scratch. If you want to leave him to his cat bed, that’s fine too. Mostly, Heath just wants a human family to nurture him and love him more than a shelter with limited resources can devote.Be that person who takes Heath in and gives him a loving fur-ever home.

Cornelia,Approx. 2 years old,F,"Cornelia was a stray kitten in Barangka, Marikina. She had a serious eye injury and she knew that she needed to be rescued. On that lucky day, a PAWS caretaker was walking on his way to the shelter and Cornelia decided to follow him. The PAWS vet could no longer save her eye, but she’s now a healthy little girl with a zest for life.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Adopt-Cornelia.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cornelia-Before.jpg']"
Friendly,Approx. 1 year old,F,"“We should call her Friendly!” was the shared sentiment when this sweet cat was fostered after having been found as an abandoned kitten on Barangka Bridge. Following fostering protocol, her paw-rents kept her in a guest bedroom until it was safe to let her meet the other foster kittens. Despite her isolation, Friendly was the chattiest and most affectionate little kitty – at least when it came to humans. With other cats, it’s another story altogether, so we recommend Friendly for solo cat households only.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Adopt-Friendly.jpg']"
Skyler,Approx. 2 years old,M,"Just like his sibling who was rescued a couple of years ago, Skyler is a white male Puspin looking for a fur-ever home filled with warmth. Skyler’s most unique trait is his one odd eye. In fact, his eyes look different. They have different colors. No matter the disparity and uniqueness, Skyler is just like any cat who needs love and warmth. Use your soothing voice to call his name, and reward him with a treat when he responds. Skyler will become unique to you after you spend time with him at our cattery and he imprints with you after a good time. Cats are smart and they remember a loving human, so be that owner who he never forgets.

Bridget Boy,Approx. 3 years old,M,"Okay, so Bridget is male and was only named Bridget because he was found at St. Bridget School, Quezon City, not because he identifies as a female cat (and there’s nothing wrong with that!) Kidding aside, some people love orange tabbies and can’t get enough of them, so PAWS presents yet another example of this type of appealing housecat with the orange and white fur.Bridget is timid and looks tired, so grab some cat toys or treats to perk him up. Cat owners who love cats jumping on the kitchen counters to join in for meal preparations will love Bridget Boy and his curious hunger for culinary treats. But he also has his bored, lazy cat moments, that is, until you invite him to play and cuddle.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bridget-Before.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Adopt-Bridget.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bridget-Before.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Adopt-Bridget.jpg']"

What a long way a loving home does for an animal anxious about the environment at a shelter. Even if Cleo has resided in PAWS for more than two years, his anxiety about finding a fur-ever home increases annually, so we’re doing what we can to change that. Cleo is in the cattery here at PAWS for anyone who wants to play with him and get to know him. Cleo just needs time with a cat lover who wants to bring out the best in him. So, what once was a kitten, now a full-grown cat and a candidate for the best decision you’ve ever made, make Cleo among your list of male Puspins to see here.","['https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20200623_082554-scaled-e1684132854413-1024x1024.jpg', 'https://paws.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_20230515_111159-scaled-e1684132765839-1024x1024.jpg']"
Foggy,Approx. 2.5 years old,M,"Foggy is the last of his litter: nicknamed the Bad Weather Boys, after the inclement conditions under which they were rescued in Loyola Memorial Park.
