Still, a loving adopter or foster parent is wise to give Sasha time to get comfortable to their home; show Sasha your sweet side and give her treats to reinforce that you love her. The rewards to showing her love are worth the choice of letting her in your home sweet home. Welcome Sasha, and home sweet home will never be the same without her again.\n",

      "Sex  M\n",
      "Desc: Okay, so Bridget is male and was only named Bridget because he was found at St. Bridget School, Quezon City, not because he identifies as a female cat (and there’s nothing wrong with that!) Kidding aside, some people love orange tabbies and can’t get enough of them, so PAWS presents yet another example of this type of appealing housecat with the orange and white fur.Bridget is timid and looks tired, so grab some cat toys or treats to perk him up. Cat owners who love cats jumping on the kitchen counters to join in for meal preparations will love Bridget Boy and his curious hunger for culinary treats.

What a long way a loving home does for an animal anxious about the environment at a shelter.

Cleo is in the cattery here at PAWS for anyone who wants to play with him and get to know him. Cleo just needs time with a cat lover who wants to bring out the best in him. So, what once was a kitten, now a full-grown cat and a candidate for the best decision you’ve ever made, make Cleo among your list of male Puspins to see here.\n",
